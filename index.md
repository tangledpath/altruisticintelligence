## Products

### Stress Sentinel
Service which Monitors anonymized employee data to predict and proactively manage levels of stress.
* Proactively address potential problems before they occur. 
* Identify situations before they become toxic. 
* BullyGuard - Stop bullying before it becomes a problem. Bullies are sneaky; they hit when the teacher isn‚Äôt looking. They are good at victim-blaming, you know, the person who has been mentally tortured in ways that are often hard to quantify. Fortunately we learned everything about bullies; how they bully, how they hide it, and how they behave. We can also identify their possible victims, sometimes before the target feels victimized.

## FOUNDATION
Starting small, currently provides online services via an online forum where people can share their experiences anonymously.   If a user wishes to share in a safe place, without the possibility of being tracked, this is that place. There will be some moderation, of course.  This isn‚Äôt a place to bash a particular company, demean, or disrespect other‚Äôs posts, etc. We utilize technology to weed out posts from bots and those who have too sharp of an axe to grind. 

The Foundation is a place where folks can for support; to find and share with others who may have experienced a toxic boss, co-worker and/or environment. 

Separately to the forum, we may allow individuals (real person with one vote per company) to _rate_ the toxicity of companies they have worked at.  This is completely anonymous. We verify the individual is real, and that they may only receive a single vote.  Bots are not allowed; these are verified real people.
